In response, the Defense Department, Defense Intelligence Unit, and AI company Quantifind launched the Countering Malign Influence project. The project uses open-source data to identify, track, and counter transnational criminal groups attempting to mask their identities and activities. The speed and volume of data collected would be too large for human analysts alone to process.\nHealth: Data collection for health research typically lacks participants with diverse backgrounds. NIHs Bridge2AI program builds participant diversity into the design of all funded projects. For example, Bridge2AI recently funded a University of Washington-led coalition to create a flagship, ethically sourced data set to uncover how human health is restored after disease. The effort, which is using Type 2 diabetes as a case study, will recruit an equal number of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, and white participants while engaging with tribal communities to address barriers to participation.\nEarth Science: Rip currents cause hundreds of drownings and require tens of thousands of rescues annually.

{"input":"What are the possible biases that have been detected in healthcare ML produced by ML interactions with patients?","output":"In the ML-patient interaction case, it is possible to detect biases including: \nPrivilege bias, i.e. some models may be unavailable in settings where protected groups receive care or require technology/sensors disproportionately available to the nonprotected class, and this also exacerbates existing inequalities between the haves and the have-nots in terms of access to the digital healthcare ecosystem; in other words, those that generate enough data on themselves to ensure accurately trained algorithms and those that do not.\nInformed mistrust bias that is given by the patients diffidence based on historical exploitation and unethical practices; protected groups may believe that a model is biased against them, and these patients may avoid seeking care from clinicians or systems that use the model or deliberately omit information, while the protected group may be harmed by this, as it results in them not receiving appropriate care and not interacting with the model, as it enhances the issue of lack of data representativeness and accuracy of that group.\nAgency bias (deeply connected to privilege bias): protected groups may not have input into the development, use and evaluation of models. Thus, they may not have the resources, education or political influence to detect biases, protest and force correction concerning the consideration or treatment of patients, especially those belonging to protected groups."}
{"input":"Tell me about CRISPR and AI and Chinas stance on this being an ethical risk.","output":"CRISPR is a controversial gene modification technique that can be used to alter the presentation of genes in living organisms, for example for the purpose of curing or preventing genetic diseases. It is closely related to AI, as Machine Learning techniques can be used to identify which gene or genes need to be altered with the CRISPR method. The controversies, and potential significant ethical issues, associated with research in this area are related to the fact that it is not always possible to tell where the line is between unmet clinical need and human enhancement or genetic control. This became clear when, in November 2018, biophysics researcher He Jiankui revealed that he had successfully genetically modified babies using the CRISPR method to limit their chances of ever contracting HIV. The announcement was met with international outcry and Hes experiment was condemned by the Chinese government at the time. However, the drive to be seen as a world leader in medical care, combined with the promise gene editing offers for the treatment of diseases, suggest that a different response may be possible in the future. Such a change in government policy is especially likely as global competition in this field heats up. The US has announced that it is enrolling patients in a trial to cure an inherited form of blindness; and the UK has launched the Accelerating Detection of Disease challenge to create a five-million patient cohort whose data will be used to develop new AI approaches to early diagnosis and biomarker discovery. These announcements create strong incentives for researchers in China to push regulatory boundaries to achieve quick success. China has filed the largest number of patents for gene-editing on animals in the world"}
{"input":"Why are nations around the world concerned about investing in artificial intelligence?","output":"Nations around the world are concerned with investing in technology to develop artificial intelligence to outperform their competition in various areas of national security."}
{"input":"What are the current efforts being pursued by countries to get ahead of their competition regarding AI?","output":"To outperform competition in the field of Artificial Intelligence, countries around the world are seeking to control access to computing resources (which are necessary to train bigger models more quickly and process large amounts of data), mitigate economic disasters related to AI failure, ensure defense related AI systems are robust and secure, and understanding how competitors are using AI."}
{"input":"What sort of problems could result from underdeveloped investment in artificial intelligence?","output":"The primary issue with not investing heavily enough in the development and responsible control of Artificial Intelligence is the risk that a competitor or bad actor develops a better, faster, or more damaging version of AI that could pose a threat to national security."}
{"input":"How might AI affect competition between nations in the future?","output":"If development and competition within the field of Artificial Intelligence largely continues unchecked, it could precipitate a different form of arms race with a wide range of detrimental economic factors as powerful nations attempt to control compute resources and materials necessary to build more complex AI models."}
{"input":"Why is artificial intelligence important for a country to invest in?","output":"Investing in artificial intelligence is one of many necessary investments for a country to meet economic success and guarantee national security. Artificial Intelligence has use cases that can affect nearly every industry, from defense and logistics to finance and automation. AI technologies are tools that can provide for more efficient allocation of resources and for help with human decision-making when too much or too little data is present."}
