I break down the regulations into their component parts—the terminology, key concepts, and specific requirements—and then trace those components to their roots, revealing how 3.The “Policy Funnel” of China’s AI Governance Major governance initiatives tend to proceed from left to right through this funnel, though often not in a linear fashion. China now appears to be following that same blueprint for AI, though on an accelerated time line. There are no firm deadlines for the national AI law, but a draft version could be released in late 2023 or 2024, followed by six to eighteen months dedicated to revising the law. During that time, many of the organizations, individuals, and intellectual influences described in this paper will be shaping one of the world’s most important pieces of legislation for AI governance. The subsequent papers in this series will dig deeper into key players in this process, illustrating how China formulates AI regulations and previewing what likely lies ahead.
About the Author: Matt Sheehan is a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where his research focuses on global technology issues, with a specialization in China’s artificial intelligence ecosystem. The Ministry of Science and Technology is another key player, one that may see its profile rise due to recent government restructuring and increased focus on regulating underlying AI research. 
Feeding into this bureaucratic rulemaking are several think tanks and scholars, notably the China Academy for Information Communications Technology and Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI International Governance.
In the years ahead, China will continue rolling out targeted AI regulations and laying the groundwork for a capstone national AI law. Any country, company, or institution that hopes to compete against, cooperate with, or simply understand China’s AI ecosystem must examine these moves closely. 
The subsequent papers in this series will dig into the details of these regulations and how they came about, deepening understanding of Chinese AI governance to date and giving a preview of what is likely coming around the bend. And despite China’s drastically different political system, policymakers in the United States and elsewhere can learn from its regulations. China’s regulations create new bureaucratic and technical tools: disclosure requirements, model auditing mechanisms, and technical per-formance standards. These tools can be put to different uses in different countries, ranging from authoritarian controls on speech to democratic oversight of automated decisionmaking.
Charting the successes, failures, and technical feasibility of China’s AI regulations can give policymakers elsewhere a preview of what is possible and what might be pointless when it comes to governing AI.
So what do China’s AI regulations contain? How did its massive party and state bureaucracies formulate them? And is it possible to predict where Chinese AI governance is headed?
This is the first in a series of three papers that will tackle these questions using a novel approach: reverse engineering.","China is the only country that has implemented a comprehensive AI law.

2,How do providers of high-risk AI systems manage post-market monitoring according to Europe Commission?,"Providers follow a step-by-step process, including conformity assessment and registration. Post-market, authorities conduct surveillance, users ensure human oversight, and providers implement monitoring systems, reporting incidents and malfunctions.","step-by-step process for declaration of conformity
Step1: A high risk AI system is developed
Step2: It needs to undergo the conformity assessment and comply with AI requirements. For some systems a notified body is involved too
Step3: Registration of stand-alone AI systems in an EU database
Step4: A declartion of conformity needs to be signed and the AI system should bear the CE marketing. The system can be placed on the market. 
Step 5: If substantial changes happen in the AI system's lifecycle, go back to step 2

How does it all work in practice for providers of high risk AI systems?
Once an AI system is on the market, authorities are in charge of market surveillance, users ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and users will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning. The EU’s second category is “high risk” AI, which is permitted but requires assessments before AI is released in the market and afterwards. This includes rigorous testing, documentation of data quality, and an accountability framework including human oversight. High risk services include autonomous vehicles, medical devices, critical infrastructure, education, and government services. Providers of high-risk AI must register their AI in an EU database managed by the Commission before introducing them in the market. Non-EU providers will require an authorized representative in the EU showing that they comply and have post-market monitoring. 

Third, “limited risk” AI systems have minimal transparency requirements so that users can make informed decisions. This includes generating or manipulating images, audio or video.

In 2022, a report commissioned for the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology stated that 
investment in the UK AI sector grew five-fold between 2019 and 2021, and that it brought in £10.6 
billion in revenue and employed over 50,000 people.28
OECD analysis published in July 2023 found that AI was changing the nature of work by assisting 
workers and reducing the time spent on mundane tasks, rather than causing job losses.29
However, some emerging academic research indicates that developments in generative AI may be linked 
to a loss in the quantity and earnings of white-collar jobs.30,31

groups. For example, the majority of clerical work is carried out by women.34–37
A 2021 report commissioned by the former Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 
highlighted a regional disparity in the net employment impacts of AI, with London and the South 
East benefitting from net job gains more than Northern England and the Midlands.34

There have been significant public policy developments relating to AI in recent years.
In 2023, the Government published a white paper outlining a ‘pro-innovation approach to AI’,21 
along with announcements including £900m for an ‘exascale’ † supercomputer.22 The Prime Minister 
hosted a global ‘AI Safety Summit’ in November 2023.23 It resulted in a declaration on AI safety 
signed by 28 countries,24 and the establishment of an AI Safety Institute25 that aims to build 
public sector capacity to research AI safety. The most likely outcome for the United States is a bottom-up patchwork quilt of executive branch actions. Unlike Europe, the United States is not likely to pass a broad national AI law over the next few years. Successful legislation is likely focused on less controversial and targeted measures like funding AI research and AI child safety. This likely disappoints proponents of strong national AI regulation. This outcome will be messier and have gaps, but no broad national law does not mean no regulation. We’re likely to see domain-specific agency actions especially in health care, financial services, housing, workforce, and child safety, plus multiple executive orders. This patchwork quilt of rules, if implemented well, could be grounded in the expertise of specific agencies and more tailored to innovation. The U.S. government will likely boost spending on AI and AI research, especially in defense and intelligence, and use its buying power to shape the market.

BACKGROUND
AI policy must protect individuals, increase transparency and accountability, and center human rights.

States and municipalities are increasingly taking interest in Artificial Intelligence and filling the gaps left by federal inaction on algorithmic harm. States and cities have taken different routes, from notification and task forces to minimum privacy standards. Some of the recent efforts are highlighted below. EPIC is not including state and local laws primarily focused on investing resources in building more AI and general research, as they do not improve protection of individuals against algorithmic harm. At the federal level, EPIC is only including laws of this sort that have been enacted, and only including laws within the last several years.

An overview of national AI strategies and
policies

As artificial intelligence (AI) advances across economies and societies, policy
makers and AI actors around the world seek to move from principles to practice.
To harness the benefits of AI while mitigating the risks, governments are
investing in AI R&D; leveraging AI in specific industries such as transportation and
healthcare; building human capacity on AI; ensuring a fair labour market
transformation; reviewing and adapting relevant policy and regulatory
frameworks and developing standards; and co-operating internationally. This
Going Digital Toolkit note provides an overview of the various AI policy
initiatives undertaken by governments and analyses these initiatives throughout
the AI policy cycle: 1) policy design; 2) policy implementation; 3) policy
intelligence; and 4) approaches for international and multi-stakeholder cooperation on AI policy. For government use of AI, the EO requires the development of guidance for agency use of AI and a faster and more efficient process for agencies to procure AI products and services. The directive also calls for the rapid hiring of AI professionals and the training of employees at all levels. The content of a forthcoming Office of Management and Budget memo will dictate the details of how government AI use will change.

EPIC has long advocated for comprehensive privacy protections, rigorous testing protocols, expanded resources for evaluation of AI systems, and a government-whole effort to fighting algorithmic discrimination.

Two days later, on November 1st, 2023, the Office of Management and Budget released a memo dictating how Government Agencies should approach using and regulating AI. There is a 30-day comment period before it’s finalized. FINDINGS FROM A REVIEW OF NATIONAL AI STRATEGIES

9,How might the government ensure that people negatively affected by AI can receive help?,"The government could help people negatively affecteed by AI in several ways that are currently available. There are numerous agencies that can support individuals who are victim to discrimination based on race, religion, sex, gender, etc. Additionally, providing a way for whistleblowers to voice their concerns anonymously could help government agencies to address issues with AI more quickly.","of the greatest opportunities for economic benefit in areas like automation and that the country is pushing forward in AI-related areas substantially. Nonetheless, efforts to cushion the disruptions that emerge from using AI in the industry are currently lacking. Thus, AI can help foster increased productivity and high levels of growth, but its use is likely to intensify the inequalities present within society and even decrease support for the government and its policies. The AIDP also promotes AI as a way to help deal with some of the major social problems, ranging from pollution to standards of living. However, positive impact in this area seem to come with increased control over individuals’ behaviour, with governance extending into the realm of moral behaviour and further erosion of privacy. Governments should look beyond traditional regulatory techniques to influence AI developments Why is AI important?
Disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to
transform governments. AI can be used as a tool that can deliver a personalized
service delivery experience, improve efficiency of back-end processes,
strengthen policy compliance and aid in the identification of fraud. Artificial
Intelligence can be defined as the programming of software systems, often
using algorithms, to carry out some tasks that have in the past usually required
human intelligence; tasks that involved human vision, speech, language,
knowledge, and search. If used correctly and used together with human
management and decision-making, governments can also use AI to address
development challenges. As government’s confront the economic and health
challenges arising from COVID 19, the impact on government’s fiscal stress
and mobility limitations on citizens and civil servants are proving to be drivers or jeopardize safety or rights.  At the same time, my Administration will promote responsible uses of AI that protect consumers, raise the quality of goods and services, lower their prices, or expand selection and availability.","Countries are at different stages of AI adoption, with some having put in place measures to manage the risks associated with AI and others having policies that encourage AI development.

10,Why is it difficult to regulate AI? ,AI is a general-purpose technology that is likely to be ubiquitous and apply to a wide range of applications. This makes it harder to regulate well.,"The rapid pace and diffusion of advanced AI technology will make multilateral regulation difficult. AI lacks the chokepoints of traditional models of nonproliferation, such as the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, meaning that it will be comparatively difficult for governments to control AI using traditional regulatory techniques. Governments should look beyond traditional regulatory techniques to influence AI developments Why do we need rules on AI?
The proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.

For example, it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme.

Although existing legislation provides some protection, it is insufficient to address the specific challenges AI systems may bring. I. The AI Regulation Debate: A Wide Spectrum of Views. The AI regulation debate has become heated and politicized, reflecting the immense hopes and fears that we have invested in AI.   

Hysterical fear and paranoia. On one end, leading technologist and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen  says “we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now.” He views this as “hysterical fear” that is “irrational” and compares it to earlier introduction of new technologies that were similarly feared but were overblown and subsequently managed. He believes that AI is simply a computer program that is owned, controlled and used by people, and that AI does not have its own goals or its own wants. Moreover, he emphasizes, AI can be a force for tremendous good.","2023-01-20

11,Why was the U.S concerned about Chinas breakthrough in AI research? ,U.S. political and military leaders were concerned that China's newfound AI capabilities would provide it with an asymmetric military advantage over the United States.,"The United States and China will lead in different ways
Although U.S. policymakers often worry that China will take the lead in a race for AI, the consensus from the experts with whom we consulted was that China is highly unlikely to produce a major new advance in AI because of U.S. superiority in empowering private sector innovation. China is unlikely to catch up to or surpass the United States in producing AI breakthroughs, but it could lead in different arenas. China's demonstrated record of refining technological capabilities produced elsewhere and the Chinese Communist Party's preferred approach of societal use cases mean that China could see greater success integrating today's technologies into its workflows, weapons, and systems, whereas the United States could fall behind in end-to-end systems integration. to innovation. The U.S. government will likely boost spending on AI and AI research, especially in defense and intelligence, and use its buying power to shape the market. AI trade friction with Europe is likely to emerge, and private companies will advance their own “responsible AI” initiatives and face a fragmented global AI regulatory landscape. Looming China competition will escalate a “don’t fall behind” debate. The Federal Trade Commission (especially) and Department of Justice likely fire warning shots to forestall AI concentration in big tech. There is a real but less likely chance that a key U.S. state (e.g., California) passes major AI legislation, or that a big AI-related disaster leads to a strong national response. The AIDP provides a longitudinal perspective on China’s strategic situation regarding AI, including its comparative capabilities, the opportunities offered, and the potential risks. Following a technology-first approach, it may be tempting to concentrate one’s attention on the stated capabilities of AI, to gain an insight into the types of technologies in which China is investing. However, this would likely offer only a short-term perspective and would soon be out of date as technological innovation advances rapidly. Furthermore, it would do little to explain why China is seeking to develop a strong AI sector in the decades to come. To this end, it is more useful to try to understand China’s strategic focus from a policy-first approach, by analysing the areas where China considers that AI presents opportunities. In this section, we focus on these areas of particular importance to China, on how and what China expects to gain from developing AI in each of them, and on some of the structural, cultural and political factors that ground China’s stance on AI, as well as an indication of its possible trajectory, while also highlighting where ethical problems remain, arise, or are likely to be exacerbated.

November 1, 2023 Finally, there remains one auxiliary goal: making China a leader in the governance and regulation of AI. U.S. and Chinese leaders frequently point out that China has laid out some of the world’s first binding regulations on AI, with the latter using it as a point of pride and the former as an impetus to action. But the rhetorical emphasis on global leadership often leads to a mistaken impression that this is a major driver of Chinese actions. An examination of the regulations and conversations with Chinese policy actors indicates otherwise. For China, Matt Sheehan | 17
being a global leader or model for AI governance is a “nice-to-have”—a small bonus for its businesses and national soft power, but not a significant driver of these AI regulations.

Organisations and individuals developing, deploying or operating AI
systems should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with
the above principles

Consistent with these principles, the OECD also provides five recommendations to
governments:
•

Facilitate public and private investment in research & development to spur
innovation in trustworthy AI.

•

Foster accessible AI ecosystems with digital infrastructure and technologies
and mechanisms to share data and knowledge.

•

Ensure a policy environment that will open the way to the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

•

Empower people with the skills for AI and support workers for a fair
transition.

•

Co-operate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible
stewardship of trustworthy AI. Great Power Public-Private Consortium
Across the world, robust partnerships among government, global industry, civil society organizations, academia, and research institutions support the rapid development and deployment of AI. These partnerships form a consortium that carries out multi-stakeholder project collaborations that access large-scale computational data and training, computing, and storage resources. Through funding from many governments, the consortium develops joint solutions and benchmarking efforts to evaluate, verify, and validate the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of AI systems. New and existing international government bodies, including the Abu Dhabi AI Council, rely on diverse participation and contributions to set standards for responsible AI use. The result is a healthy AI sector that supports economic growth that occurs concurrently with the development and evaluation of equitable, safe, and secure AI systems. The U.S., thankfully, is not alone in pushing ahead on domestic forms of AI governance. For instance, the EU AI Act is close to being finalized and countries such as Brazil, the U.K., Canada, and Japan are all developing their own approaches to AI governance. While domestic AI governance is where addressing risks from AI and developing AI’s social and economic potential must begin, these domestic efforts are building blocks to international AI governance. The work of the Brookings/CEPS Forum on Cooperation in AI (FCAI)—a track 1.5 multistakeholder dialogue—has over the last three-plus years been focused on identifying opportunities for international cooperation on AI, and this work is now even more pressing in light of the pace and scope of domestic AI governance mechanisms being developed globally. The EOAI helps here by tasking the Departments of State and Commerce to “establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AI benefits and managing its risks and ensuring safety.” 60 http://thefuturesociety.org/2020/03/17/unesco-regional-forum-on-ai-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/

14,How effective are current US export controls at limiting the unlawful sale and distribution of advanced technologies?,"Currently, export controls are not very effective at restricting access to advanced technology, foreign agents devote large amounts of resources to circumvent existing US export controls. Evidence has been found indicating the presence of Western manufacured technology like microchips in sanctioned nations' missiles.","Improved Export Controls Enforcement Technology Needed for U.S. National Security
Executive Summary
As technology has become increasingly central to strategic competition with Russia and China, export controls have moved to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy on technology issues. Most notably, restricting Russia’s access to advanced technology through export controls is a key part of the U.S. response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as U.S. government officials have repeatedly stated.

Unfortunately, nearly all the debate is focused on whether and when to apply export controls, not how to ensure that export controls are effectively administered and enforced once applied. On October 7, 2022, the Department of Commerce announced major changes to export control policies toward China for the procurement of advanced AI and semiconductor technology used in both commercial and military AI systems. This policy document included important acknowledgments that previous export control approaches—based on restricting the sale of dual-use technologies to military end users or for military end uses—had diminished in effectiveness over the past decade. Specifically, the new policy stated that controls prior to October 7 “generally only apply when the ‘U.S. person’ has knowledge that their activities are contributing to prohibited end uses or end users. China’s military-civil fusion effort makes it more difficult to tell which items are made for restricted end uses, thereby diminishing the effect of these existing controls.” The October 7, 2022, package of export controls against China is too new for comparable data to be available at the time of this writing, but the same caution applies: published government data does not necessarily tell the whole story, which must focus on both licit and illicit transactions. 

For BIS, the scale and complexity of U.S. export control requirements have increased massively over the past three years due to new legislative and executive requirements.

For those exports that do require a license, the typical process for export controls administration and enforcement is depicted in Figure 1.



Increasingly sophisticated and well-resourced attempts by Russian and Chinese organizations to evade export controls are not the only reason that BIS’s job has become significantly harder in recent years. Legislation and executive orders have posed new challenges to BIS in administering and enforcing export controls in at least three ways. The Huawei and ZTE export controls were a potent reminder to the U.S. foreign policy community of the power of export controls. U.S. technology export controls were able to do significant damage to the financial prospects of leading Chinese technology giants. The United States did this entirely with non-violent means and at a limited cost to the U.S. economy.

However, major weaknesses in U.S. export control enforcement capacity are evident, as demonstrated by Russia’s success in evading controls for weapons used in Ukraine.","Question:  How effective are current US export controls at limiting the unlawful sale and distribution of advanced technologies?

Answer:  While export controls are a vital tool in foreign policy, they are not a panacea.

Measures can focus on regulating training data, algorithms, or computing power, or they can simply impose requirements on the final actions taken by an AI product, leaving the remedies up to the developer. China’s approach to AI governance has been uniquely focused on algorithms. including by facilitating the exchange of AI governance experiences that can inform approaches to domestic AI governance; addressing the externalities and extraterritorial impacts of domestic AI governance that can otherwise stifle innovation and reduce opportunities for uptake and use of AI; and finding ways to broaden access globally to the computing power and data that is essential for building and training AI models. Accountability and governance: Businesses should put in place governance measures that ensure effective oversight of the supply and use of AI systems, with clear lines of accountability established across the AI lifecycle. Regulators will likely implement this principle through regulatory guidance and assurance techniques.
Contestability and redress: Users, impacted third parties, and actors in the AI lifecycle should be able to contest an AI decision or outcome that is harmful or creates material risk of harm. Regulators will be expected to clarify existing routes to contestability and redress and implement proportionate measures to ensure that the outcomes of AI use are contestable where appropriate.

What is the main difference between the Bank's Access to Information Policy (AI Policy) and the previous
Disclosure policy?

The AI Policy, launched in 2010, moved the Bank from an approach that spelled out what information is disclosed to
one that allows the Bank to disclose any information in its possession that is not on a list of exceptions set out in the AI
Policy.

        Under the AI Policy, significantly more information on Bank operations and Board proceeding is available.
        The new Policy permits public release of some documents prior to discussion by the World Bank's Board of
         Executive Directors.
        Certain restricted information is eligible for declassification after 5, 10, or 20 years.
        It also establishes an appeal mechanism that provides public recourse when the Bank denies access to
         information. Go Top
What can be disclosed under the AI Policy?

The Bank can disclose any information in its possession, provided that the information does not fall under one or more
of the exceptions set out in the AI Policy or the Bank has decided, on an exceptional basis, to restrict access to the
information.

                                                                                                                    Go Top

What are the exceptions to disclosing information?

The Policy explicitly sets out 10 categories of information that are considered to be exceptions and not eligible for
declassification: In the UK
While there is no current body of UK law specifically regulating AI, there are numerous laws that 
restrict how AI can be used in practice,93,226 including (HoC Library briefing on AI and employment

Joshua P. Meltzer
November 1, 2023 The U.S., thankfully, is not alone in pushing ahead on domestic forms of AI governance. For instance, the EU AI Act is close to being finalized and countries such as Brazil, the U.K., Canada, and Japan are all developing their own approaches to AI governance. While domestic AI governance is where addressing risks from AI and developing AI’s social and economic potential must begin, these domestic efforts are building blocks to international AI governance. The work of the Brookings/CEPS Forum on Cooperation in AI (FCAI)—a track 1.5 multistakeholder dialogue—has over the last three-plus years been focused on identifying opportunities for international cooperation on AI, and this work is now even more pressing in light of the pace and scope of domestic AI governance mechanisms being developed globally. The EOAI helps here by tasking the Departments of State and Commerce to “establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AI benefits and managing its risks and ensuring safety.” International co-operation on AI
International co-operation to promote the beneficial use of AI and address its

20,What are the possible biases that have been detected in healthcare ML produced by ML interactions with patients?,"In the ML-patient interaction case, it is possible to detect biases including: 
Privilege bias, i.e. some models may be unavailable in settings where protected groups receive care or require technology/sensors disproportionately available to the nonprotected class, and this also exacerbates existing inequalities between the haves and the have-nots in terms of access to the digital healthcare ecosystem; in other words, those that generate enough data on themselves to ensure accurately trained algorithms and those that do not.
Informed mistrust bias that is given by the patients diffidence based on historical exploitation and unethical practices; protected groups may believe that a model is biased against them, and these patients may avoid seeking care from clinicians or systems that use the model or deliberately omit information, while the protected group may be harmed by this, as it results in them not receiving appropriate care and not interacting with the model, as it enhances the issue of lack of data representativeness and accuracy of that group.
Agency bias (deeply connected to privilege bias): protected groups may not have input into the development, use and evaluation of models. Thus, they may not have the resources, education or political influence to detect biases, protest and force correction concerning the consideration or treatment of patients, especially those belonging to protected groups.","In the specific domain of healthcare, four categories of biases have been detected as peculiar to the healthcare ML model (Rajkomar et al. 2018):

(1) Biases in healthcare ML depending on model design (such as label biases and cohort biases).

(2) Biases in healthcare ML depending on training data (such as minority bias, missing data bias, informativeness bias and training serving skew).

(3) Biases in healthcare ML produced by the ML interactions with clinicians (such as automation bias, feedback loops, dismissal bias and allocation discrepancy).

(4) Biases in healthcare ML produced by ML interactions with patients (such as privilege bias, informed mistrust and agency bias). In the latter case (i.e. ML–patient interaction), it is possible to detect other kinds of biases, which include the following:

(a)
Privilege bias, i.e. some models may be unavailable in settings where protected groups receive care or require technology/sensors disproportionately available to the nonprotected class, and this also exacerbates existing inequalities between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ in terms of access to the digital healthcare ecosystem (Morley et al. 2020); in other words, those that generate enough data on themselves to ensure accurately trained algorithms and those that do not (Topol 2019). Fairness in healthcare ML is operationalised in this sense by assessing and re-equilibrating the representativeness of data for protected categories on the basis of which the healthcare ML model is trained and learns to identify patterns, which it uses to produce specific outcomes.

The last two categories identified above instead concern biases that can arise from the interaction between the healthcare ML model with clinicians or patients. In the former (i.e. ML–clinician interaction), it is possible to distinguish the following biases:

(a) Automation biases that are due to an overreliance of clinicians on the ML model, also caused by clinicians’ unawareness of the inaccuracy of the ML model for a protected group, leading them to act inappropriately on inaccurate predictions. On the one hand, ML capacity to discover probabilistically correlations, find new patterns and thus produce novel knowledge for health is described as the promise of medicine (Hinton 2018; Norgeot et al. 2019; Chin-Yee and Upshur 2019). It already exhibits great potential in several health application fields, from clinical diagnosis (Álvarez-Machancoses et al. 2019; Fleming 2018), high levels of precision in cancer prediction (Kuo et al. 2001) and diabetes detection (Barakat et al. 2010; Gulshan et al. 2016), to personalised and prevention medicine (Barton et al. 2019), drug discovery (Hay et al. 2013) and epidemiology (Fleming 2018; Álvarez-Machancoses and Fernández-Martínez 2019). Those who advocate for the use of ML in healthcare indeed stress how ML can fix flaws of clinicians, such as their predisposition towards cognitive biases and hence to commit diagnostic errors, and how ML can increase operational efficiency in the healthcare system by reducing resource waste and increasing","Healthcare ML can be biased by the following factors:

1.  Bias in the training data, which reflects the underlying social and economic inequities in society.

2.  Bias in the model itself, which can perpetuate these inequities through automated decision-making.

3.  Bias in the interactions between patients and ML, which can be harmful to patients’ well-being and undermine trust","=>

aims to accelerate the development and deployment of AI in Singapore. The
strategy adopts a human-centric approach to AI and focuses on an initial five
national projects of high social and economic value in logistics, municipal

strengthen five ecosystem enablers, which include talent and education, data
architecture, a progressive and trusted environment, international
collaboration, and a “triple-helix” partnership between the research
community, industry and government. The strategy also identifies key nontechnological hurdles in AI deployment which Singapore believes it is uniquely
positioned to address (e.g. stakeholder buy-in, governance, process change)
and outlines Singapore’s plans to become a global hub for developing, testbedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions.

23,What are the basic principles of China’s New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development,"(1) Technology-Led. Grasp the global development trend of AI, highlight the deployment of forward-looking research and development, explore the layout in key frontier domains, long-term support, and strive to achieve transformational and disruptive breakthroughs in theory, methods, tools, and systems; comprehensively enhance original innovation capability in AI, accelerate the construction of a first-mover advantage, to achieve high-end leading development.
(2) Systems Layout. According to the different characteristics of foundational research, technological research and development, industrial development, and commercial applications, formulate a targeted systems development strategy. Fully give play to the advantages of the socialist system to concentrate forces to do major undertakings, promote the planning and layout of projects, bases, and a talent pool, organically link already-deployed major projects and new missions, continue current urgent needs and long-term development echelons, construct innovation capacity, create a collaborative force for institutional reforms and the policy environment.
(3) Market-Dominant. Follow the rules of the market, remain oriented toward application, highlight companies’ choices on the technological line and primary role in the development of commercial product standards, accelerate the commercialization of AI technology and results, and create a competitive advantage. Grasp well the division of labor between government and the market, better take advantage of the government in planning and guidance, policy support, security and guarding, market regulation, environmental construction, the formulation of ethical regulations, etc.
(4) Open-Source and Open. Advocate the concept of open-source sharing, and promote the concept of industry, academia, research, and production units each innovating and in principal pursuing joint innovation and sharing. Follow the coordinated development law for economic and national defense construction; promote two-way conversion and application for military and civilian scientific and technological achievements and co-construction and sharing of military and civilian innovation resources; form an all-element, multi-domain, highly efficient new pattern of civil-military integration. Actively participate in global research and development and management of AI, and optimize the allocation of innovative resources on a global scale.
","A limited number of reports have attempted to assess the plausibility of China’s AI strategy given China’s current technical capabilities (Ding 2018; “China AI Development Report” 2018). Others have sought to understand specific areas of development, for instance, security or economic growth (Barton et al. 2017; “Net Impact of AI on jobs in China” 2018; Allen 2019). However, to grasp the ramified implications and direction of the AIDP, it is insufficient to analyse specific elements in isolation or to consider only technical capabilities. Instead, a more comprehensive and critical analysis of the driving forces behind China’s AI strategy, its political economy, cultural specificities, and the current relevant policy debates, is required to understand China’s AI strategy. This is the task we undertake in this article. This is the first in a series of three papers that will tackle these questions using a novel approach: reverse engineering.
The approach begins with the finished product: the regulations on AI and algorithms that China has already adopted. The papers will break down the regulations into their component parts—the terminology, concepts, and requirements embedded in them—and then trace those components backward. They will trace their progress through China’s “policy funnel” (see figure 1) by examining the political and social roots of the ideas; how they were shaped by CCP ideology, influenced by international AI discourse, and debated by Chinese scholars and companies; and finally formalized by bureaucratic entities. This approach will clarify the specific aims and likely impacts of China’s AI regulations and help to build a conceptual model for how China makes AI policy. Introduction: Over the past two years, China has rolled out some of the world’s first binding national regulations on artificial intelligence (AI). 
These regulations target recommendation algorithms for disseminating content, synthetically generated images and video, and generative AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. 
The rules create new requirements for how algorithms are built and deployed, as well as for what information AI developers must disclose to the government and the public. 
Those measures are laying the intellectual and bureaucratic groundwork for a comprehensive national AI law that China will likely release in the years ahead, a potentially momentous development for global AI governance on the scale of the European Union’s pending AI Act. 
Together, these moves are turning China into a laborato-ry for experiments in governing perhaps the most impactful technology of this era. 2 AI legislation in China","?

25,"At the heart of the EU AI act stands its risk categorization system, what belong to the unacceptable risk systems?","Risk systems include those that have a significant potential for manipulation either through subconscious messaging and stimuli, or by exploiting vulnerabilities like socioeconomic status, disability, or age. AI systems for social scoring, a term that describes the evaluation and treatment of people based on their social behavior, are also banned. ","Under this fragmentation in AI governance approach, the G7 members agreed that policies and regulations should be risk-based and forward-looking. However, policymakers should be cautious about using the term “risk-based.” The EU AI Act defines risk-based as the classification of AI systems into four categories: unacceptable, high-risk, limited, or minimal/low, depending on the purposes and actors using the system (e.g., social scoring by governments is classified as “unacceptable,” while critical infrastructures that could put the life and health of citizens at risk are classified as “high risk”). In contrast, the U.S. NIST AI Risk Management Framework assumes that risk is assessed for each AI system based on the magnitude of risk and probability of occurrence. In short, the term risk-based varies from country to country, and its common meaning may not differ significantly from the general principle of regulation: necessary and proportional. The Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:
pyramid showing the four levels of risk: Unacceptable risk; High-risk; limited risk, minimal or no risk
 
All AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour.

High risk:
AI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in: The EU’s AI Act intends to be the “world’s first comprehensive AI law”. Central to the EU’s approach, AI systems are classified into four tiers of risk, and different tiers are subject to different regulations. Implementation will be a challenge, for example even defining AI systems and AI risks is problematic. EU businesses have released an open letter stating it “would jeopardize Europe's competitiveness and technological sovereignty without effectively tackling the challenges we are and will be facing”. A new EU AI office would be created to monitor enforcement. Penalties include fines of up to 6% of total worldwide revenue. Citizens also have the right to file complaints against the AI provider. 

AI that falls in the EU’s highest risk category of “unacceptable risk” is prohibited, with certain limited exceptions. Examples include social scoring that classifies people based on behavior and socio-economic status, or real-time biometric identification like face recognition. The EU’s second category is “high risk” AI, which is permitted but requires assessments before AI is released in the market and afterwards. This includes rigorous testing, documentation of data quality, and an accountability framework including human oversight. High risk services include autonomous vehicles, medical devices, critical infrastructure, education, and government services. Providers of high-risk AI must register their AI in an EU database managed by the Commission before introducing them in the market. Non-EU providers will require an authorized representative in the EU showing that they comply and have post-market monitoring. 

Third, “limited risk” AI systems have minimal transparency requirements so that users can make informed decisions. This includes generating or manipulating images, audio or video. 

Fourth, “low/minimal risk” AI systems have no new obligations, but likely voluntary codes of conduct.","How will the EU AI act ensure the right of EU citizens to sue for AI-related rights violations?

The Office of Science and Technology Policy released a wide-ranging “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in Fall 2022, a document setting out how people should be able to expectThe five major principles are Safe and Effective Systems; Freedom from Algorithmic Discrimination; Data Privacy; Notice and Explanation; Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback. The document lays out why these principles are critical, examples of where they are violated, and examples of how they’ve been addressed. Monday’s White House action builds on its previous commitments to the safe and responsible development of AI. Some of these include its support for developing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which safeguards Americans’ rights and safety; securing voluntary commitments from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and other tech companies to thoroughly test systems before releasing them – also called “red-teaming” – and clearly labeling all AI-generated content; and granting $140 million to the National Science Foundation to establish seven new AI research institutes. The Order is also meant to complement the G7 leaders’ Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct, which was also issued on Monday. (See below for more details.) To advance President Biden’s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified five principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that protects all people from these threats—and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. Responding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, technologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by From Principles to Practice—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including detailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help provide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public’s rights, opportunities, or access to critical needs. (d)  Artificial Intelligence policies must be consistent with my Administration’s dedication to advancing equity and civil rights.  My Administration cannot — and will not — tolerate the use of AI to disadvantage those who are already too often denied equal opportunity and justice.  From hiring to housing to healthcare, we have seen what happens when AI use deepens discrimination and bias, rather than improving quality of life.  Artificial Intelligence systems deployed irresponsibly have reproduced and intensified existing inequities, caused new types of harmful discrimination, and exacerbated online and physical harms.  My Administration will build on the important steps that have already been taken — such as issuing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, the AI Risk Management Framework, and Executive Order 14091 of February 16, 2023 (Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government) — in seeking to ensure that AI complies","2023.

A prescriptive, static, and detailed regulation could stifle innovation, so Japan prefers respecting companies' voluntary efforts and providing nonbinding guidance for AI governance.","The Ministry of Science and Technology is another key player, one that may see its profile rise due to recent government restructuring and increased focus on regulating underlying AI research. 
Feeding into this bureaucratic rulemaking are several think tanks and scholars, notably the China Academy for Information Communications Technology and Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI International Governance.
In the years ahead, China will continue rolling out targeted AI regulations and laying the groundwork for a capstone national AI law. Any country, company, or institution that hopes to compete against, cooperate with, or simply understand China’s AI ecosystem must examine these moves closely. 
The subsequent papers in this series will dig into the details of these regulations and how they came about, deepening understanding of Chinese AI governance to date and giving a preview of what is likely coming around the bend. So far, most of the activity in the crafting of AI regulations has occurred in the third and fourth layers.

Real-World Roots
This layer is composed of the economic, political, social, and technological conditions that create the need for new policy and also limit the options for regulators. Like public policy anywhere in the world, Chinese AI regulations often get their initial impetus from an exogenous shift in the real world. This can be a major evolution in technological capabilities, a new business model emerging, or a shift in underlying social or political conditions in the country. Such changes provide a spark, a problem that needs to be addressed through a change in public policy. The other components of this layer—economic, political and social conditions—then help set the scope of what is possible with a regulation and what costs are acceptable. 2 AI legislation in China But in the West, China’s regulations are often dismissed as irrelevant or seen purely through the lens of a geopolitical competition to write the rules for AI. 
Instead, these regulations deserve careful study on how they will affect China’s AI trajectory and what they can teach policymakers around the world about regulating the technology. Even if countries fundamentally disagree on the specific content of a regulation, they can still learn from each other when it comes to the underlying structures and technical feasibility of different regulatory approaches.
In this series of three papers, I will attempt to reverse engineer Chinese AI governance.","Japan is the only G7 country that does not have general, legally-binding regulations for AI use(1).
The reason for this is that Japan has no legal framework for AI governance due to the lack of specific legislation(2).

Blog Post by Bill Whyman

Published October 10, 2023

“AI is too important not to regulate—and too important not to regulate well,” says Google. It is highly likely that Artificial Intelligence will be regulated. In many ways, it already is. The EU’s AI Act has extensive top-down prescriptive rules including prohibiting uses of AI that it says pose unacceptable risk; it’s in the final stages of passing. China has ruled that algorithms must be reviewed in advance by the state and “should adhere to the core socialist values”. The United States is taking its typical decentralized approach. The most likely outcome for the United States is a bottom-up patchwork quilt of executive branch actions. Unlike Europe, the United States is not likely to pass a broad national AI law over the next few years. Successful legislation is likely focused on less controversial and targeted measures like funding AI research and AI child safety. This likely disappoints proponents of strong national AI regulation. This outcome will be messier and have gaps, but no broad national law does not mean no regulation. We’re likely to see domain-specific agency actions especially in health care, financial services, housing, workforce, and child safety, plus multiple executive orders. This patchwork quilt of rules, if implemented well, could be grounded in the expertise of specific agencies and more tailored to innovation. The U.S. government will likely boost spending on AI and AI research, especially in defense and intelligence, and use its buying power to shape the market.

data protection and digital information.
•   Some stakeholders have indicated that additional legislation and action may be required, 
including mandatory impact assessments, bans on certain AI applications, and a right for human 
intervention to challenge AI decision- making. There are concerns that regulators are not currently 
equipped with the staffing, expertise or funding to regulate AI.
Policy implications of artificial intelligence (AI)
Background This viewpoint proposes ten key parameters of successful AI regulatory design and the likely outcomes. AI raises many profound questions. Nearly all agree that AI promises both huge benefits for society and yet poses major risks. The challenge is getting the balance right between innovation and societal risks – which governments don't have a good record of achieving. The devil is in the details, making rules adaptable for a technology that is likely to change rapidly and be pervasive. The existential question of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is generating much debate. However, this is more distant and tough to forecast accurately. We focus here on issues like model safety, bias, transparency, privacy, security, trust, copyright, content regulation, education, and economic impacts (job loss, work force adjustment, productivity). For commercial actors, the key question is regulation’s impact on innovation, and does it address society’s concerns so that adoption is broad and","### Question:  How does the G7 statement on AI risk management agree on the need for regulation?

An AI regulatory sandbox is meant to systematically improve communication betweenregulators and regulated entities, most frequently AI developers. Participation in AIsandboxes, which is often voluntary, is meant to ease regulatory compliance and offerlegal certainty to companies while improving regulators’ understanding of the design,development, and deployment of a type of AI system. This may also help regulatorsidentify potential legal problems with a particular AI system during its development. Inaddition to preventing harms, this can enable an AI developer to make earlier—therebypotentially less costly—course corrections on its algorithms. Accountability and governance: Businesses should put in place governance measures that ensure effective oversight of the supply and use of AI systems, with clear lines of accountability established across the AI lifecycle. Regulators will likely implement this principle through regulatory guidance and assurance techniques.
Contestability and redress: Users, impacted third parties, and actors in the AI lifecycle should be able to contest an AI decision or outcome that is harmful or creates material risk of harm. Regulators will be expected to clarify existing routes to contestability and redress and implement proportionate measures to ensure that the outcomes of AI use are contestable where appropriate. The government’s initial non-statutory approach will not create new rights or new routes to redress at this stage. Spain

COMMENTARY
The AI regulatory toolbox: How governments candiscover algorithmic harms
Alex Engler
October 9, 2023
While AI legislation advances, some regulators are experimenting with gathering information aboutalgorithmic systems and their potential societal effects.
This experimentation has developed a toolbox of AI regulatory strategies, each with differentstrengths and weaknesses.
These potential interventions include transparency requirements, algorithmic audits, AI sandboxes,leveraging the AI assurance industry, and welcoming whistleblowers.
Of particular interest is how oversight agencies can learn about algorithmic systems,as well as their societal impact, harms, and legal compliance. As agencies experimentin gathering this information, it is possible to broadly characterize an emerging AIregulatory toolbox for evaluating algorithmic systems, particularly those with greaterrisk of harm. that might be less discriminatory instead of simply detecting biased results. Further,regulators can encourage and highlight AI assurance companies that establishprocesses which enable some degree of independent scrutiny, such as with consistentevaluation standards, although this is challenging to do when AI assurance companiesdepend on AI developers for revenue.
Regulators should also welcome information from affected individuals andwhistleblowers from AI developers—both of whom may have unique information aboutalgorithmic systems.
Individuals who are subjected to algorithmic systems may have specific insight intothe function of those systems. Several U.S. agencies, such as the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission, explicitly","### Question: How do whistleblowers fit into the AI regulatory framework?

BACKGROUND
AI policy must protect individuals, increase transparency and accountability, and center human rights.

States and municipalities are increasingly taking interest in Artificial Intelligence and filling the gaps left by federal inaction on algorithmic harm. States and cities have taken different routes, from notification and task forces to minimum privacy standards. Some of the recent efforts are highlighted below. EPIC is not including state and local laws primarily focused on investing resources in building more AI and general research, as they do not improve protection of individuals against algorithmic harm. At the federal level, EPIC is only including laws of this sort that have been enacted, and only including laws within the last several years. Principles and International Agreements
U.S. STATE AND LOCAL LAWS (ENACTED)
No meaningful federal legislation has passed, however states have been very active.

EPIC has published “State of State AI Policy” to track the fast-moving world of AI legislation in states and localities around the country.

34,What role do trade agreements play in AI governance?,"Free trade agreements (FTAs) and DEAs include provisions that enhance access to AI and support its governance, such as commitments to cross-border data flows and avoiding data localization requirements. They also include AI-specific commitments focused on cooperation and alignment in areas like AI standards.","AI governance has been a focus of discussions in the G7, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). Going forward, even more intensive engagement is needed through these international forums, in FCAI, as well as progress in developing international AI standards. Expanding commitments in trade agreements and digital economy agreements is another opportunity to build the needed international cooperation on AI governance. AI governance can utilize different parts of the AI supply chain as a point of entry. Measures can focus on regulating training data, algorithms, or computing power, or they can simply impose requirements on the final actions taken by an AI product, leaving the remedies up to the developer. China’s approach to AI governance has been uniquely focused on algorithms. Second, much of what the U.S. ends up doing in terms of domestic AI governance will influence international AI outcomes. For example, the White House Voluntary AI Commitments have become the basis for the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems released by the G7 on October 30.

Third, the raft of new AI standards and guidelines across the federal government that the EOAI mandates will influence how governments and industries across the world approach AI governance. This will happen as the sheer size of the U.S. government procurement market incentivizes companies to converge on the U.S. AI standards and guidelines. Moreover, it is likely that many of these AI standards will be further developed and internationalized through more formal AI standards-setting processes in global standards development bodies such as the ISO/IEC. Domain Specific Outcomes 

Trade conflict emerges with the EU and others, creating a fragmented global regulatory environment. The United States likely globally advances its AI principles and voluntary business commitments to influence international rules (vs. China and EU approaches). IPR and copyright will be especially important for creative industries. The EU’s AI Act will likely influence other major nations, frustrating U.S. leadership. Leading companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia likely face multiple AI regimes around the world.   

Antitrust agencies lead the effort to forestall “big tech” companies dominating AI, false and deceptive practices, and AI-driven fraud. The high cost and scale of AI foundation models likely leads to market concentration. We expect FTC actions designed as warnings shots to industry.","AI governance will likely require cooperation across borders. Trade agreements can facilitate this by establishing binding commitments and processes for consultation and dispute resolution. However, trade agreements alone will not be sufficient to address all challenges related to AI governance.

. Regulators can issue guidance that encourages regulated companies toconsider using AI assurance tools, even possibly noting this could be interpreted as apotential signal of regulatory compliance. Further, regulators can inform and learn fromthe AI assurance industry. By communicating about specific technical functions andthe societal impacts of algorithmic systems in a regulated field, regulators can help AIassurance companies strive towards not just nominal compliance, but meaningfullybetter outcomes. For instance, regulators concerned with discrimination couldencourage relevant AI assurance companies to Accountability and governance: Businesses should put in place governance measures that ensure effective oversight of the supply and use of AI systems, with clear lines of accountability established across the AI lifecycle. Regulators will likely implement this principle through regulatory guidance and assurance techniques.
Contestability and redress: Users, impacted third parties, and actors in the AI lifecycle should be able to contest an AI decision or outcome that is harmful or creates material risk of harm. Regulators will be expected to clarify existing routes to contestability and redress and implement proportionate measures to ensure that the outcomes of AI use are contestable where appropriate. The government’s initial non-statutory approach will not create new rights or new routes to redress at this stage. Leverage the AI Assurance Industry 4.
thereproducibility that is necessary
A common strand across the entire AI assurance industry is a mixed business modelthat advertises both profit-motivated improvements to algorithmic systems and betterpreparedness for regulatory and legal compliance. For instance, several AI assurancecompanies stress the value of internal monitoring, so corporate leaders canunderstand and scrutinize the function of their own algorithms, in addition tohighlighting future legal requirements. This likely a stronger sales pitch to potentialclients, especially given that most AI laws are still being drafted, rather than beingimplemented.
Although this industry is distinct from governance, regulators should actively engagewith the AI assurance industry to advance democratic goals, perhaps best “Carrots” encouraging “good AI” outcomes and “sticks” for enforcement and penalties. Regulation often works best when it uses carrots (incentives, safe harbors) as well as sticks (penalties). Google and others focus on “good AI” outcomes such as an AI-ready workforce, investing in AI innovation and competitiveness, and supporting broad AI adoption. The EU AI Act takes a strong enforcement approach and has big financial penalties. U.S. AI efforts have been mostly voluntary, such as the White House July 21, 2023 commitments from AI companies.  

Scope. AI supply chain including cloud data centers. For high risk uses, some want regulation to apply not just to the model developer, but to applications and the IT infrastructure it runs on, even including components.

36,What is the significance of a common definition of AI for regulatory purposes?,A common definition of AI for regulatory purposes is important for guiding future cooperation in AI and determining the level of ambition that can be reached by such a process. It helps in converging on a common understanding of AI and its configurations and techniques,"Defining AI: There will be no legal definition of AI. Instead, “AI” is defined by reference to the combination of two characteristics: (1) adaptivity—i.e., being “trained” and operating by inferring patterns and connections in data which are not easily discernible to humans; and (2) autonomy—i.e., making decisions without the express intent or ongoing control of a human. Defining AI with reference to functional capabilities is intended to future-proof the framework against unanticipated new technologies that are autonomous and adaptive.
Context-specific – Regulating use, not technology: The framework will regulate outcomes that AI is likely to generate. This approach could even extend to failure to use AI; the government highlighted feedback received from regulators that failure to exploit AI capabilities may in fact risk harm, such as not utilizing AI in safety-critical processes. I. The AI Regulation Debate: A Wide Spectrum of Views. The AI regulation debate has become heated and politicized, reflecting the immense hopes and fears that we have invested in AI.   

Hysterical fear and paranoia. On one end, leading technologist and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen  says “we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now.” He views this as “hysterical fear” that is “irrational” and compares it to earlier introduction of new technologies that were similarly feared but were overblown and subsequently managed. He believes that AI is simply a computer program that is owned, controlled and used by people, and that AI does not have its own goals or its own wants. Moreover, he emphasizes, AI can be a force for tremendous good. This subset excludes several laws and regulations that impact AI development, such as the 2021 Personal Information Protection Law. It also excludes local government regulations, such as those covering autonomous vehicles, and national policy documents that focus on stimulating the AI industry rather than regulating it. The study includes some regulations that focus on algorithms rather than AI itself. It also briefly covers government documents that lay out high-level guidance for the ethics and governance of AI. Within that scope, table 1 outlines ten particularly significant AI governance documents. “…Prevent the risk of China achieving global AI dominance…” and ensure “We win, they lose.”   

In between the EU’s more interventionist approach and venture capitalists’ more hands-off approach, many businesses and civil society groups are advocating for varying degrees of regulation. For example, Microsoft has proposed a comprehensive approach in its, “Governing AI: A Blueprint for the Future”. It would create a new government AI agency, a new AI-legal framework, require safety brakes for AI systems that control critical infrastructure, and would license AI datacenters that run critical AI.  

AI rules create winners and losers, as some are constrained, and others have more freedom and resources. Governments—leery of being criticized for heavy handed regulation—are quick to speak of innovation but are also responding to public concerns about AI.

Commentary by Hiroki Habuka

Published June 6, 2023

Introduction
The G7 Summit, held from May 19 to 21, 2023, left a strong impression of unity among global leaders. Emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), along with national security and energy, was highlighted as a key area requiring a strong alliance among G7 countries toward fundamental values such as democracy and human rights. The G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ Meeting, which took place a little earlier, also discussed responsible AI and global AI governance as one of the central topics. With the recent launch of large language AI models such as GPT-4, society anticipates a rapid integration of AI technologies, making it crucial to discuss the responsible use of AI and its governance. However, even the like-minded G7 countries approach AI governance differently, ranging from strict, comprehensive laws to sector-specific guidelines. Because of this, the consensus among G7 leaders on trustworthy AI will have a big impact on the way AI systems should be developed and operated around the world. This commentary takes a close look at two important outcome documents from the 2023 G7 summit that broach the subject of AI governance: the G7 Summit Communiqué and the Declaration of the G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ Meeting— collectively referred to as the G7 statements—to predict potential cooperation on AI governance among the G7 countries.

Shared Understanding of Values, Principles, and Risks
Establishing Common Values The European Union (EU) Commission embraced the G7 leaders’ agreement and swiftly issued a call to action. “I am pleased to welcome the G7 international Guiding Principles and the voluntary Code of Conduct, reflecting EU values to promote trustworthy AI. I call on AI developers to sign and implement this Code of Conduct as soon as possible,” said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a press release. (Later this week, Von der Leyen will be joining other global leaders in Buckinghamshire for the two-day UK AI Safety Summit. More details below.) G7 Leaders issue ‘Guiding Principles’ and voluntary ‘Code of Conduct’ on AI
On Monday, Group of Seven (G7) leaders issued a set of international Guiding Principles on artificial intelligence as well as a voluntary Code of Conduct for AI developers under the ‘Hiroshima Artificial Intelligence Process.’ In a joint statement, leaders called on organizations developing advanced AI systems to commit to the code of conduct as well as ministers to accelerate development of the Process’ policy framework.

The Principles and Code are the culmination of work that began in May 2023 at the G7 summit, where the Hiroshima AI Process – born out of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council ministerial – was formed to find common policy priorities and promote guardrails for advanced AI systems globally. The G7 bloc includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, the US, and the European Union.","The G7 leaders issued a declaration on the final day of the G7 summit, committing to the full implementation of the G7 AI Principles and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI).

The AI regulatory toolbox: How governments candiscover algorithmic harms

October 9, 2023
While AI legislation advances, some regulators are experimenting with gathering information aboutalgorithmic systems and their potential societal effects.
This experimentation has developed a toolbox of AI regulatory strategies, each with differentstrengths and weaknesses.
These potential interventions include transparency requirements, algorithmic audits, AI sandboxes,leveraging the AI assurance industry, and welcoming whistleblowers.
Of particular interest is how oversight agencies can learn about algorithmic systems,as well as their societal impact, harms, and legal compliance. As agencies experimentin gathering this information, it is possible to broadly characterize an emerging AIregulatory toolbox for evaluating algorithmic systems, particularly those with greaterrisk of harm. Agencies should use the tools they have to understandand regulate AI
Regulators should actively consider what steps are necessary and valuable in theirdomains to ensure their regulatory mission is preserved. This includes cataloging andobserving emerging uses of algorithmic systems in their field, exploring what theirexisting statutory authority allows for, and hiring staff with expertise in algorithmicsystems.

We identified three areas of particular relevance: international competitiveness, economic growth, and social governance (construction). The development and deployment of AI in each of these areas have implications for China and for the international community. For example, although the ‘trump-card’ policy to gain a military advantage may not be something new, its application to AI technologies risks igniting an arms race and undermining international stability (Taddeo and Floridi 2018). Efforts to counteract this trend seem largely hollow.

The administration likely builds on its AI “bill of rights” that spans different sectors, voluntary commitments, and executive orders. Voluntary rules are seen by many as a stop-gap measure, but a divided Congress is unlikely to pass a major law with new mandatory rules.  

Actions addressing sensitive areas such as health care, financial services (lending, insurance, housing), work force practices (discrimination), and child safety are more likely. Executive branch agencies are likely to move forward with existing authorities in the absence of new laws. 

Private tech companies advance their own responsible AI initiatives to serve their customers and avoid tougher government action. These are largely voluntary and seen as insufficient. Shaping Europe’s digital future - AI Act

The Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally.
The regulatory proposal aims to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI. At the same time, the proposal seeks to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The proposal is part of a wider AI package, which also includes the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. Together, the Regulatory framework and Coordinated Plan will guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI. And, they will strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU. Policy implications of artificial intelligence (AI)

The European Union is currently finalising an AI Act.232 As it stands, the Act is designed to work 
with existing EU legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital 
Services Act (DSA). The EU’s AI Act intends to be the “world’s first comprehensive AI law”. Central to the EU’s approach, AI systems are classified into four tiers of risk, and different tiers are subject to different regulations. Implementation will be a challenge, for example even defining AI systems and AI risks is problematic. EU businesses have released an open letter stating it “would jeopardize Europe's competitiveness and technological sovereignty without effectively tackling the challenges we are and will be facing”. A new EU AI office would be created to monitor enforcement. Penalties include fines of up to 6% of total worldwide revenue. Citizens also have the right to file complaints against the AI provider. 

AI that falls in the EU’s highest risk category of “unacceptable risk” is prohibited, with certain limited exceptions. Examples include social scoring that classifies people based on behavior and socio-economic status, or real-time biometric identification like face recognition.","The EU AI Act has significant penalties for non-compliance. Violations can result in fines of up to 7% of total global revenue or €70 million euros. In extreme cases, the act allows for the potential shutdown of an entire company.

Policy implications of artificial intelligence (AI)
Image ownership
AI can be used to recreate voices and images imitating living or deceased individuals.178 This can 
have benefits in the arts, such as using AI for the consensual de-aging of performers.179
On the other hand, creative sector trade unions have raised concerns around companies being able to 
recreate the likeness of living or dead performers in perpetuity,180,181 with implications for what make ‛companies—and regulators—wary of overseas listings, which would entail greater disclosure and scrutiny’ (Lucas 2019). Although this, and other similar practices, do involve anonymisation, they are in stark contrast with the European and US approaches to the use of medical data, which prioritise individual autonomy and privacy, rather than social welfare. A fair balance between individual and societal needs is essential for an ethical approach to personal data, but there is an asymmetry whereby an excessive emphasis on an individualistic approach may be easily rectified with the consensus of the individuals, whereas a purely societal approach remains unethical insofar as it overrides too easily individual rights and cannot be rectified easily. in Artificial Intelligence, Technical University of Munich.

48,What challenges do China's AI regulations pose to AI developers?,"Ensuring compliance with detailed regulatory requirements, such as truth and accuracy in training data and outputs, could be technically and operationally challenging.","These positions are rooted in an aspect of reality, but they also create a blind spot: the regulations themselves. The specific requirements and restrictions they impose on China’s AI products matter. They will reshape how the technology is built and deployed in the country, and their effects will not stop at its borders. 
They will ripple out internationally as the default settings for Chinese technology exports. They will influence everything from the content controls on language models in Indonesia to the safety features of autonomous vehicles in Europe. China is the largest producer of AI research in the world, and its regulations will drive new research as companies seek out techniques to meet regulatory demands. 
As U.S.-and Chinese-engineered AI systems increasingly play off one another in financial markets and international airspace, understanding the regulatory constraints and fail-safe mechanisms that shape their behavior will be critical to global stability. And despite China’s drastically different political system, policymakers in the United States and elsewhere can learn from its regulations. China’s regulations create new bureaucratic and technical tools: disclosure requirements, model auditing mechanisms, and technical per-formance standards. These tools can be put to different uses in different countries, ranging from authoritarian controls on speech to democratic oversight of automated decisionmaking.
Charting the successes, failures, and technical feasibility of China’s AI regulations can give policymakers elsewhere a preview of what is possible and what might be pointless when it comes to governing AI.
So what do China’s AI regulations contain? How did its massive party and state bureaucracies formulate them? And is it possible to predict where Chinese AI governance is headed?
This is the first in a series of three papers that will tackle these questions using a novel approach: reverse engineering. 2 AI legislation in China So far, most of the activity in the crafting of AI regulations has occurred in the third and fourth layers.

Real-World Roots
This layer is composed of the economic, political, social, and technological conditions that create the need for new policy and also limit the options for regulators. Like public policy anywhere in the world, Chinese AI regulations often get their initial impetus from an exogenous shift in the real world. This can be a major evolution in technological capabilities, a new business model emerging, or a shift in underlying social or political conditions in the country. Such changes provide a spark, a problem that needs to be addressed through a change in public policy. The other components of this layer—economic, political and social conditions—then help set the scope of what is possible with a regulation and what costs are acceptable.","China's AI regulations present both opportunities and challenges to the sector. On the one hand, the regulations offer opportunities for AI developers to benefit from China's massive market and support from the government. They also provide a clear legal framework for AI development, helping to ensure the system is safe and ethical. On the other hand, the regulations also pose significant challenges, including compliance costs and limitations on the free flow of data and technology","=> 17.

Having in place a policy for the ethical use of AI is fundamental to managing the adverse consequences of AI use in public policy.
The ethical use of AI means that these systems should not harm humans. Rather, they are used to enhance overall human
wellbeing. Since the software decision-making may result in bias, it is critical that there are policies in place for dealing with the
governance and oversight of the use of AI solutions. critical infrastructures (e.g. transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk;

It does not only require a formal equality of opportunity, ensured, for example, through the legal system; it entails the substantial promotion of opportunities as real chances for every person to express their agency and, therefore, the development of adequate conditions for people to afford them. For this reason, fair equality of opportunity needs to be considered along with the difference principle, which emphasises attention to the expectations and conditions of the least advantaged, not only to access but also to substantially enjoy those chances. The paper is structured as follows. In the second section, we provide an overview of the state of the art of the discussion of the AI ethics principle of fairness in HMLA and show that the concept of fairness underlying this debate is framed in purely distributive terms and overlaps with non-discrimination, which is defined in turn as the absence of biases. At the end of the section, we question whether the concept of fairness so understood is adequate for the discussion of fairness in HMLA or whether the latter calls for a more complex concept of fairness that requires more than just non-discrimination and an exclusively distributive dimension, and that includes features and criteria that extend beyond the consideration of biases. Moreover, the different distributive justice options mentioned above are sometimes incompatible (Friedler et al. 2016; Dieterich et al. 2016); for example, a model may be fair with respect to the outcomes but unfair with respect to the allocation (and vice versa), but it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for any ML model to satisfy all conditions (Chouldechova 2017).

This general difficulty in defining what fairness in HMLA is (Friedler et al. 2016) and how to ensure and promote it emerges in the debate as clear proof of the fact that ‘ML fairness is not just a task for ML specialists, but requires ethical reasoning’ (Rajkomar et al. 2018) and that ‘framing fairness as a purely technical problem is problematic’ (McCradden et al. 2020). administration charged with delivering them; but several risks also arise.

 - Strengthening resilience to AI threats: Adopting strategies of resilience to mitigate potential threats by focusing on areas like biosecurity, countering cybersecurity threats, strengthening democratic resilience, and developing emergency response options for various threats from state, sub-state, and non-state actors.
 - Non-traditional regulatory techniques: In order to truly encapsulate the everchanging AI landscape it is important for governments to look into non-traditional regulatory frameworks like investing in publicly owned data sets for AI research, issuing challenge grants for socially beneficial AI uses, establishing uniform liability rules for developers, and setting requirements for AI assessment.
 - Funding innovation: By funding national AI resources and partnering with private sector, the government can introduce improvements in risk assessments for dealing with unexpected AI-enabled issues","What should government policymakers do to protect humanity?
The potential dangers posed by AI are many. At the extreme, they include the threat of human extinction, which could come about by an AI-enabled catastrophe, such as a well-designed virus that spreads easily, evades detection, and destroys our civilization. Less dire, but considerably worrisome, is the threat to democratic governance if AIs gain power over people.[2] Even if AIs do not kill humans or overturn democracy, authoritarian regimes, terrorist groups, and organized crime groups could use AI to cause great harm by spreading disinformation and manipulating public opinion. Governments need to view the AI landscape as a regulatory training ground in preparation for the threats posed by even more-advanced AI capabilities, including the potential arrival of artificial general intelligence. Governments should focus on strengthening resilience to AI threats In addition to more-traditional regulatory practices, government policies on AI should focus on strategies of resilience to mitigate potential AI threats because strategies aimed solely at denial will not work. AI cannot be contained through regulation, so the best policy will aim to minimize the harm that AI might do. This will probably be most critical in biosecurity, [3] but harm reduction also includes countering cybersecurity threats, strengthening democratic resilience, and developing emergency response options for a wide variety of threats from state and sub- and non-state actors. Governments will either need to adopt entirely new capabilities to put this policy into action or expand existing agencies, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Governments should take a more comprehensive approach to regulation beyond hardware controls, which will not be enough to mitigate harms in the long run. Governments should look beyond traditional regulatory techniques to influence AI developments","### Question: What are some ways in which governments can mitigate potential threats posed by AI?

On Monday, President Joseph Biden issued a highly-anticipated “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The first-of-its-kind executive action is the White House’s attempt to quickly establish oversight of the rapidly evolving technology while Congress works to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework. The document is devoted, in large part, to national security concerns, doling out various new responsibilities to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and other agencies. But nearly the entire alphabet soup of federal agencies is implicated.","How might the executive branch respond to congressional action on the subject?

First, it is important to note that the G7 statements do not attempt to harmonize the approaches and policy instruments of the G7 members, declaring that “the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members.” Furthermore, the declaration emphasizes that policies and regulations should take into account not only technical and institutional characteristics, but also social and cultural impacts, including geographic, sectoral, and ethical aspects. In fact, there are policy differences among G7 members, from the European Union (France, Germany, and Italy) and Canada, which promote comprehensive and binding regulations for AI, to Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which promote sector-specific guidance-based policies. G7 Leaders issue ‘Guiding Principles’ and voluntary ‘Code of Conduct’ on AI
On Monday, Group of Seven (G7) leaders issued a set of international Guiding Principles on artificial intelligence as well as a voluntary Code of Conduct for AI developers under the ‘Hiroshima Artificial Intelligence Process.’ In a joint statement, leaders called on organizations developing advanced AI systems to commit to the code of conduct as well as ministers to accelerate development of the Process’ policy framework.

The Principles and Code are the culmination of work that began in May 2023 at the G7 summit, where the Hiroshima AI Process – born out of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council ministerial – was formed to find common policy priorities and promote guardrails for advanced AI systems globally. The G7 bloc includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, the US, and the European Union. International harmonization. Nearly every country is having its own debate about AI’s dramatic impact. Different national rules will inevitably conflict, including intellectual property rights and antitrust. The EU AI Act is almost certain to be more regulatory than the U.S. approach, and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council is coordinating their differences. The G7 has launched the “Hiroshima AI process”. The OECD has developed AI principles, and the United Nations has proposed a new UN AI advisory body to better include views of developing countries. International technical standards, such as developed via ISO and IEEE, are a promising approach that should be considered. Shared R&D and education assistance can also encourage AI harmonization.  

III. Likely Outcome: A Bottom-up Patchwork Quilt of AI Rules. The Path to Trustworthy AI G7 Outcomes and Implications for Global AI Governance

Commentary by Hiroki Habuka

Published June 6, 2023

Introduction
The G7 Summit, held from May 19 to 21, 2023, left a strong impression of unity among global leaders. Emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), along with national security and energy, was highlighted as a key area requiring a strong alliance among G7 countries toward fundamental values such as democracy and human rights. The G7 Digital and Tech Ministers’ Meeting, which took place a little earlier, also discussed responsible AI and global AI governance as one of the central topics.","What are the differences between the EU and US in terms of AI regulations?

59,How are the White House Voluntary AI Commitments influencing international AI outcomes?,"The White House Voluntary AI Commitments have become the basis for the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems released by the G7, influencing international AI outcomes.","The United States is likely to take a decentralized bottom-up approach that is messy and may have gaps and inconsistencies. This will likely disappoint proponents of strong AI regulation. Yet, over time this may produce a patchwork quilt of AI rules that if implemented well is grounded in the expertise of specific agencies and more tailored to innovation. The tremendous risks and opportunities of AI have made it a presidential-level issue. The White House is coordinating executive agencies, as each moves ahead with actions in its own domain. The lack of meaningful regulation of social media is widely seen as a failure in Washington, and bolsters efforts to be more proactive with AI. Yet the decentralized structure of the U.S. government, political differences, and the complexities of AI forestall big, quick actions. There is also a real but less-likely probability that a big AI-related failure sparks a strong national government action. On October 30, the White House released a detailed and comprehensive executive order on AI (EOAI)—the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The EOAI mobilizes the federal government to develop guidelines and principles, and compile reports on AI use and its development. The EOAI, along with the AI Bill of Rights, the Voluntary AI Commitments, and work on AI standards sum to an increasingly coherent and comprehensive approach to AI governance. U.S. leadership on AI governance is critical, particularly given the role of the U.S. as a leading developer and investor in AI, including more recently foundational AI models such as ChatGPT4. However, international cooperation on AI governance is also needed to make domestic AI governance efforts more effective, including by facilitating the exchange of AI governance experiences that can inform approaches to domestic AI governance; addressing the externalities and extraterritorial impacts of domestic AI Second, much of what the U.S. ends up doing in terms of domestic AI governance will influence international AI outcomes. For example, the White House Voluntary AI Commitments have become the basis for the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems released by the G7 on October 30.

Third, the raft of new AI standards and guidelines across the federal government that the EOAI mandates will influence how governments and industries across the world approach AI governance. This will happen as the sheer size of the U.S. government procurement market incentivizes companies to converge on the U.S. AI standards and guidelines. Moreover, it is likely that many of these AI standards will be further developed and internationalized through more formal AI standards-setting processes in global standards development bodies such as the ISO/IEC. on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy that responsibly and lawfully harnesses AI capabilities, like autonomous functioning systems. And finally, the White House announced a philanthropic-giving initiative with ten foundations that have collectively committed more than $200 million to advance AI priorities.","The Voluntary AI Commitments are meant to serve as a baseline for domestic AI governance, but the White House hopes that these principles will also influence international AI governance.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lattice-m-a-canyonbridge-trump/trump-bars-chinese-backed-firm-from-buying-u-s-chipmaker-latticeidUSKCN1BO2ME Government affiliated bodies and private companies have also developed their own AI ethics principles. For example, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, a research and development body including China’s leading companies and Beijing universities, was established in November 2018 (Knight 2019). This body then released the ‘Beijing AI Principles’ to be followed for the research and development, use, and governance of AI (“Beijing AI Principles” 2019). Similar to the principles forwarded by the AIDP Expert Committee, the Beijing Principles focus on doing good for humanity, using AI ‘properly’, and having the foresight to predict and adapt to future threats. In the private sector, one of the most high-profile ethical framework has come from the CEO of Tencent, Pony Ma. This framework emphasises the importance of AI being available, reliable, comprehensible, and controllable (Si 2019).

In the years ahead, China will continue rolling out targeted AI regulations and laying the groundwork for a capstone national AI law. Any country, company, or institution that hopes to compete against, cooperate with, or simply understand China’s AI ecosystem must examine these moves closely. 
The subsequent papers in this series will dig into the details of these regulations and how they came about, deepening understanding of Chinese AI governance to date and giving a preview of what is likely coming around the bend.

AI governance can utilize different parts of the AI supply chain as a point of entry. Measures can focus on regulating training data, algorithms, or computing power, or they can simply impose requirements on the final actions taken by an AI product, leaving the remedies up to the developer. China’s approach to AI governance has been uniquely focused on algorithms.

It also excludes local government regulations, such as those covering autonomous vehicles, and national policy documents that focus on stimulating the AI industry rather than regulating it.

Social governance, or more literally in Chinese ‘social construction’,Footnote7 is the third area in which AI is promoted as a strategic opportunity for China. Alongside an economic slowdown, China is facing emerging social challenges, hindering its pursuit of becoming a ‘moderately prosperous society’ (AIDP 2017). An aging population and constraints on the environment and other resources are explicit examples provided in the AIDP of the societal problems that China is facing. Thus, the AIDP outlines the goal of using AI within a variety of public services to make the governance of social services more precise and, in doing so, mitigate these challenges and improve people’s lives.

ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS - NOTE 4 When relating this back to AI policy, China has benefited from the abundance of data that historically lax privacy protections have facilitated (Ding 2018). On the surface, China’s privacy legislation seems to contradict other development commitments, such as the Social Credit System, which requires extensive personal data. This situation creates a dual ecosystem whereby the government is increasingly willing to collect masses of data, respecting no privacy, while simultaneously admonishing tech companies for the measures they employ (Sacks and Laskai 2019). Recall that private companies, such as the AI National Team, are relied upon for governance at both a national and local level, and therefore may receive tacit endorsement rather than admonishment in cases where the government’s interests are directly served. As a result, the ‘privacy strategy’ within China appears to aim to protect the privacy of a specific type of consumer, rather than that of citizens as a whole, allowing the Privacy and data protection

68,How does China view AI in terms of international competition and military capabilities?," AI is seen as a critical element for enhancing national competitiveness and security. China aims to leverage AI to leapfrog developments in military capabilities, positioning itself as a significant player in international competition.","3 China’s AI strategic focus In this article, we analysed the nature of AI policy within China and the context within which it has emerged, by mapping the major national-level policy initiatives that express the intention to utilise AI. We identified three areas of particular relevance: international competitiveness, economic growth, and social governance (construction). The development and deployment of AI in each of these areas have implications for China and for the international community. For example, although the ‘trump-card’ policy to gain a military advantage may not be something new, its application to AI technologies risks igniting an arms race and undermining international stability (Taddeo and Floridi 2018). Efforts to counteract this trend seem largely hollow. Our analysis indicates that China has some of the greatest opportunities for economic benefit in areas like automation and that the country is pushing forward in AI-related areas substantially. Nonetheless, efforts to cushion the disruptions A limited number of reports have attempted to assess the plausibility of China’s AI strategy given China’s current technical capabilities (Ding 2018; “China AI Development Report” 2018). Others have sought to understand specific areas of development, for instance, security or economic growth (Barton et al. 2017; “Net Impact of AI on jobs in China” 2018; Allen 2019). However, to grasp the ramified implications and direction of the AIDP, it is insufficient to analyse specific elements in isolation or to consider only technical capabilities. Instead, a more comprehensive and critical analysis of the driving forces behind China’s AI strategy, its political economy, cultural specificities, and the current relevant policy debates, is required to understand China’s AI strategy. This is the task we undertake in this article. AI presents opportunities. In this section, we focus on these areas of particular importance to China, on how and what China expects to gain from developing AI in each of them, and on some of the perceived risks present in each of these areas. The AIDP highlights three areas where AI can make a substantial difference within China: international competition, economic development, and social governance. They are strictly interrelated but, for the sake of clarity, we shall analyse them separately, and contextualise each of them by discussing the relevant literature surrounding the broader political backdrop and contemporary policy debates.","China’s AI strategy incorporates a range of government policies aimed at securing a competitive advantage in the field of artificial intelligence.

April 04, 2023
The UK government published a white paper on March 29 setting out a “pro-innovation” UK regulatory framework for artificial intelligence (AI). The framework centers upon five cross-sectoral principles, of which implementation will be context-specific to the use of AI, rather than the technology itself. The government does not propose introducing a new regulator or any new legal requirements on businesses, instead leveraging existing powers of UK regulators and their domain-specific expertise. largely regulates AI via existing laws enforced by existing regulators. It outlined cross-sectoral 
principles, such as safety, security, robustness, transparency, fairness, accountability, 
contestability, and redress, for existing regulators to consider. The approach applies to the whole 
of the UK, although some policy areas are devolved.
•  The Government has brought forward legislation and regulatory action on automated vehicles and 
data protection and digital information.
•   Some stakeholders have indicated that additional legislation and action may be required, 
including mandatory impact assessments, bans on certain AI applications, and a right for human 
intervention to challenge AI decision- making. There are concerns that regulators are not currently 
equipped with the staffing, expertise or funding to regulate AI.
Policy implications of artificial intelligence (AI)
Background Governments should look beyond traditional regulatory techniques to influence AI developments New centralized coordinating functions: The government will establish cross-sectoral monitoring, risk assessment, education, horizon-scanning, and other centralized functions in order to support implementation and coherence of the framework.
AI assurance techniques and technical standards: The government suggests that these will play a critical role in supporting the framework, which it will encourage by publishing a toolkit of assurance techniques in collaboration with industry.
Territorial application: The framework applies across the United Kingdom and will not change the territorial application of any existing legislation. The UK government will work with international partners to promote interoperability and coherence between different approaches, noting the complex and cross-border nature of AI supply chains.
Cross-Sectoral Principles

The principles of the regulatory framework are explained further below:","Central functions are meant to provide guidance and support to the UK's AI regulators. They include:

Its mandate includes project-oriented collaboration on responsible AI, data governance, the future of work, and commercialization and innovation.","Responsible entity: Consortium of countries
Description: GPAI is an international and multi-stakeholder initiative that
advances cutting-edge research and pilot projects on AI priorities to advance
the responsible development and use of AI that respects human rights and
shared democratic values, as elaborated in the OECD’s Recommendation on AI.
The Partnership was conceived by Canada and France during their G7
presidencies and, at its launch on 15 June 2020, counted 13 other founding
members: Australia, the EU, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New
Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom and the United States. With
its Secretariat hosted at the OECD, the GPAI brings together experts from
industry, government, civil society and academia.
GPAI’s mission is to “support the development and use of AI based on human
rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth while seeking to
address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals”. Two Centres of AI governance has been a focus of discussions in the G7, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). Going forward, even more intensive engagement is needed through these international forums, in FCAI, as well as progress in developing international AI standards. Expanding commitments in trade agreements and digital economy agreements is another opportunity to build the needed international cooperation on AI governance. The first expected drivers of such tools are international organizations such as the OECD and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the GPAI. In particular, the OECD is the organization mentioned most often in the G7 statements, not only as the issuer of the OECD AI Principles, but also as the research hub such as mapping the commonalities and differences between trustworthy AI frameworks. UNESCO published a document, Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, in 2021, and various projects are underway to put it into practice. GPAI is a multi-stakeholder, academia-led initiative that aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice on AI, including the research on use of privacy enhancing technologies, the use of AI to solve environmental problems, and many other projects. discussion of all aspects of AI development and its impact on the economy and
society.
In February 2020, the European Commission issued a “White Paper on Artificial
Intelligence” – A European Approach to Excellence and Trust. The paper
considers requiring a pre-marketing conformity assessment for “high-risk” AI
applications such as facial recognition, as a core element of a potential
regulatory framework for AI. In addition, the white paper proposes a voluntary
“quality label” for AI applications considered not to be high-risk. In parallel, the
European Commission is reviewing EU product safety and liability regimes in
light of AI.

Participation in AIsandboxes, which is often voluntary, is meant to ease regulatory compliance and offerlegal certainty to companies while improving regulators’ understanding of the design,development, and deployment of a type of AI system. This may also help regulatorsidentify potential legal problems with a particular AI system during its development. Inaddition to preventing harms, this can enable an AI developer to make earlier—therebypotentially less costly—course corrections on its algorithms. There is no specific technical definition of an AI sandbox; the term can refer to a rangeof approaches from a simple ongoing exchange of documentation (from companies)and feedback (from regulators) all the way to a computing environment shared by acompany and regulators. This creates some uncertainty—for instance, while theEuropean Parliament’s version of the AI Act requires each EU member state toestablish at least one regulatory sandbox, it is not clear what precisely each countrywould implement.
The first such AI sandbox has been

Unlike Europe, the United States is not likely to pass a broad national AI law over the next few years. Successful legislation is likely focused on less controversial and targeted measures like funding AI research and AI child safety. This likely disappoints proponents of strong national AI regulation. This outcome will be messier and have gaps, but no broad national law does not mean no regulation. We’re likely to see domain-specific agency actions especially in health care, financial services, housing, workforce, and child safety, plus multiple executive orders.

Such actions may include a requirement that United States IaaS Providers require foreign resellers of United States IaaS Products to provide United States IaaS Providers verifications relative to those subsections.

     4.3.  Managing AI in Critical Infrastructure and in Cybersecurity.  (a)  To ensure the protection of critical
infrastructure, the following actions shall be taken: First, new responsibilities have been added to BIS without additional resources to carry them out. For example, in 2021, the responsibility for regulating and administering exports of firearms moved from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce. However, none of the staff or budget that was performing this function made a move. Similarly, two executive orders during the Trump administration made the Department of Commerce responsible for a broad swath of activities regulating imports of foreign telecommunications equipment, a job ultimately given to BIS. In the Biden administration’s Commerce Department budget request for FY 2023, BIS has identified more than $53 million in unfunded requirements from recent legislation and executive orders. (iii)  Provide that the Secretary of Commerce, in accordance with such standards and procedures as the Secretary may delineate and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, may exempt a United States IaaS Provider with respect to any specific foreign reseller of their United States IaaS Products, or with respect to any specific type of account or lessee, from the requirements of any regulation issued pursuant to this subsection.  Such standards and procedures may include a finding by the Secretary that such foreign reseller, account, or lessee complies with security best practices to otherwise deter abuse of United States IaaS Products. (iii)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of HHS shall, in consultation with relevant agencies as the Secretary of HHS deems appropriate, consider appropriate actions to advance the prompt understanding of, and compliance with, Federal nondiscrimination laws by health and human services providers that receive Federal financial assistance, as well as how those laws relate to AI.  Such actions may include:

               (A)  convening and providing technical assistance to health and human services providers and payers about their obligations under Federal nondiscrimination and privacy laws as they relate to AI and the potential consequences of noncompliance; and

77, What is agile governance in the context of Japan's AI regulation?," Agile governance in Japan's AI regulation refers to the approach of respecting companies' voluntary efforts for AI governance while providing nonbinding guidance, based on multistakeholder dialogue, to support or guide these efforts, with the guidance being continuously updated in a timely manner.","As the word “stakeholder” frequently appears in the G7 statements, the future of AI governance will likely not rely solely on top-down, government-led rule-setting. Instead, it suggests an approach where multi-stakeholder initiatives are discussed on a case-by-case basis and updated in an agile manner. Regulations and technical standards serve as critical tools to facilitate these efforts in building trustworthy AI. However, it is crucial to note that the key players in AI governance, who develop and use these tools, will be not only the government entities, but rather the private stakeholders including AI developers, users, and civil society organizations, and so on. AI governance can utilize different parts of the AI supply chain as a point of entry. Measures can focus on regulating training data, algorithms, or computing power, or they can simply impose requirements on the final actions taken by an AI product, leaving the remedies up to the developer. China’s approach to AI governance has been uniquely focused on algorithms. In this series of three papers, I will attempt to reverse engineer Chinese AI governance. 
I break down the regulations into their component parts—the terminology, key concepts, and specific requirements—and then trace those components to their roots, revealing how 3.The “Policy Funnel” of China’s AI Governance Major governance initiatives tend to proceed from left to right through this funnel, though often not in a linear fashion. The TGDS is an expert group of leading academics and practitioners from G7 member countries. It proposed the “Governance Principles for a Society Based on Cyber-Physical Systems” framework, which emphasizes the need for an agile, distributed and multi-stakeholder process (so-called Agile Governance) for Cyber-Physical Systems with AI at its core. The report further suggested a policy package to promote Agile Governance, that includes (1) proactive governance by organizations and individuals that deploy or operate aspects of CPS, (2) expert involvement and utilization of digital tools, (3) agile regulatory governance, (4) reliable certification mechanisms, (5) effective enforcement systems and appropriately tailored liability systems, and (6) legal remedial measures. Such an integrated policy framework will provide an important perspective for the development of an interoperable governance framework for responsible AI.
Conclusion","Agile governance refers to a regulatory approach that is responsive to technological change and adapts to new challenges while maintaining regulatory effectiveness. The OECD describes agile governance as “a model in which governments set direction, establish strategic goals and policies, and govern through policies that enable, not prescribe, how those goals are achieved. It entails a continuous interaction with stakeholders to adapt policy to emerging circumstances and to improve","=>  Governance that can quickly adapt to the rapid pace of AI's development.

White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights
The Office of Science and Technology Policy released a wide-ranging “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights” in Fall 2022, a document setting out how people should be able to expectThe five major principles are Safe and Effective Systems; Freedom from Algorithmic Discrimination; Data Privacy; Notice and Explanation; Human Alternatives, Consideration, and Fallback. The document lays out why these principles are critical, examples of where they are violated, and examples of how they’ve been addressed. The Senate hearing’s theme coincides with Senator Schumer’s third AI ‘Insight Forum,’ which will bring big bank and union leaders together to establish a “new foundation for AI policy in the workplace” and “ensure the use of AI benefits everyone,” as first reported by FedScoop. Tuesday’s hearing will be at least the fourth that Congress has hosted this month alone, including a House hearing on Safeguarding Data and Innovation (see a transcript on Tech Policy Press) and the Senate Commerce hearing on CHIPS and Science Implementation and Oversight.

11:30 AM – The bipartisan group of US Senators that calls itself the AI “Gang of Four” – Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), and Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) – heads to the White House to meet with President Biden. The convening comes less than 24 hours after President Biden issued his Executive Order on AI and on the eve of the third Senate AI ‘Insight Forum’ led by Sen. Schumer. To advance President Biden’s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified five principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that protects all people from these threats—and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. Responding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, technologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by From Principles to Practice—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including detailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help provide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public’s rights, opportunities, or access to critical needs.","President Joseph Biden

ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS - NOTE 4

Overview of AI Flagship Initiatives Observed
As observed across the eleven countries reviewed,
the AI policymaking landscape has a wide range
of policy and regulatory approaches. Some
governments focus on regulation, policy reform,
soft law and multi-stakeholder partnerships to
create an “enabling” environment for AI adoption,

as in the case of Finland. Other countries opt for
a more “directing” approach centered on strategic
investments, direct funding and establishing new
centers, such as in the UAE. The analysis of the
country cases has also identified some common
flagship initiatives which are summarized in Box 2.

BOX 2: Overview of Common AI Flagship Initiatives Observed Effective implementation of national AI initiatives hinges on coordination
Countries pursue different national governance models to co-ordinate the
implementation of their national AI policies across government, offering
regulatory and ethical oversight (Figure 1). Models include:
•

Assigning oversight of the development and implementation strategies
to an existing ministry, department or body. Among existing ministries
or agencies tasked with developing or implementing an AI strategy, the
following tend to drive the creation of AI strategies most often: 1)
information technology and communications ministries; 2) economics or
finance ministries; or 3) education, science (and technology) and
innovation ministries.

•

Creating a new governmental or independent AI co-ordination entity.

                    capabilities and that humans should focus on areas where AI cannot match our abilities. However, I am concerned about the 
                    ramifications of AI-driven job losses and the need for government to address these challenges proactively.
                    Governments must work with the private sector and civil society to develop a whole-of-government approach that leverages the

On Monday, President Joseph Biden issued a highly-anticipated “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The first-of-its-kind executive action is the White House’s attempt to quickly establish oversight of the rapidly evolving technology while Congress works to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework. The document is devoted, in large part, to national security concerns, doling out various new responsibilities to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and other agencies. But nearly the entire alphabet soup of federal agencies is implicated. At the Executive Order’s signing, President Biden characterized the current regulatory atmosphere around AI policy as “a genuine inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we make in the very near term are going to set the course for the next decades.” AI brings change with it that has as much potential as it does risk, he said such as “exploring the universe, fighting climate change, ending cancer as we know it, and so much more.”

The Executive Order was met with warm response from Congress and some civil society groups. The Executive Order can be broken down into eight parts, as outlined by CNBC:
Creating new safety and security standards for AI
Protecting consumer privacy
Protecting consumers overall by evaluating potentially harmful AI-related health-care practices
Supporting workers
Promoting innovation and competition
Working with international partners to implement AI standards globally
Developing guidance for federal agencies’ use and procurement of AI
Advancing equity and civil rights by creating guidance and research that avoids further algorithmic discrimination On October 30, the White House released a detailed and comprehensive executive order on AI (EOAI)—the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The EOAI mobilizes the federal government to develop guidelines and principles, and compile reports on AI use and its development. The EOAI, along with the AI Bill of Rights, the Voluntary AI Commitments, and work on AI standards sum to an increasingly coherent and comprehensive approach to AI governance. U.S. leadership on AI governance is critical, particularly given the role of the U.S. as a leading developer and investor in AI, including more recently foundational AI models such as ChatGPT4. However, international cooperation on AI governance is also needed to make domestic AI governance efforts more effective, including by facilitating the exchange of AI governance experiences that can inform approaches to domestic AI governance; addressing the externalities and extraterritorial impacts of domestic AI","### Question:  What is the purpose of the AI Executive Order?

This is why the 3-year plan promoting the AIDP (2018–2020) emphasises coordination between provinces and local governments. Another point to consider is that the G7 statements do not explicitly address the link between regulations and standards. Even if international standards are established, unless they are aligned with each country's regulatory content and civil liability systems, businesses could still face challenges due to regulatory inconsistencies. This suggests a need for ongoing discussions among nations, not just to support the development of standards, but also to understand the interplay between regulations and standards.
Further Collaboration in DFFT and Emerging Technologies (iv)   Within 240 days of the completion of the guidelines described in subsection 4.3(a)(iii) of this section, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall coordinate work by the heads of agencies with authority over critical infrastructure to develop and take steps for the Federal Government to mandate such guidelines, or appropriate portions thereof, through regulatory or other appropriate action.  Independent regulatory agencies are encouraged, as they deem appropriate, to consider whether to mandate guidance through regulatory action in their areas of authority and responsibility. Third, the government has become increasingly creative in creating complex new rules that are often more difficult to administer and enforce. For example, the U.S. approach to export controls has changed significantly via the Foreign Direct Product (FDP) Rule, which consists of an extraterritorial application of U.S. export controls on items manufactured with U.S. equipment, inputs, or design. The application of the FDP rule imposes new license requirements on exports to Russia and China and institutes a presumption of denial policy for license applications for exports or re-exports to Russia and China. The FDP rule is intended to restrict Russia and China’s abilities to acquire critical goods such as microelectronics, telecommunications items, and other components with military applications, including from third countries.","The purpose of CAN/DGSI 103-1:2023 is to establish a standard for the security and integrity of information systems in Canada, covering all aspects from design to operation.

85, What potential benefits could arise from aligning AI regulation internationally? ," By aligning AI regulation, specialized AI firms could thrive globally, competition would be encouraged, markets would be healthier, and there would be more innovation in AI. Moreover, it could lead to reduced barriers to innovation and diffusion, facilitating a larger market for AI solutions and fostering international trade.","Governments should look beyond traditional regulatory techniques to influence AI developments These positions are rooted in an aspect of reality, but they also create a blind spot: the regulations themselves. The specific requirements and restrictions they impose on China’s AI products matter. They will reshape how the technology is built and deployed in the country, and their effects will not stop at its borders. 
They will ripple out internationally as the default settings for Chinese technology exports. They will influence everything from the content controls on language models in Indonesia to the safety features of autonomous vehicles in Europe. China is the largest producer of AI research in the world, and its regulations will drive new research as companies seek out techniques to meet regulatory demands. 
As U.S.-and Chinese-engineered AI systems increasingly play off one another in financial markets and international airspace, understanding the regulatory constraints and fail-safe mechanisms that shape their behavior will be critical to global stability. So far, most of the activity in the crafting of AI regulations has occurred in the third and fourth layers.

Real-World Roots
This layer is composed of the economic, political, social, and technological conditions that create the need for new policy and also limit the options for regulators. Like public policy anywhere in the world, Chinese AI regulations often get their initial impetus from an exogenous shift in the real world. This can be a major evolution in technological capabilities, a new business model emerging, or a shift in underlying social or political conditions in the country. Such changes provide a spark, a problem that needs to be addressed through a change in public policy. The other components of this layer—economic, political and social conditions—then help set the scope of what is possible with a regulation and what costs are acceptable. “…Prevent the risk of China achieving global AI dominance…” and ensure “We win, they lose.”   

In between the EU’s more interventionist approach and venture capitalists’ more hands-off approach, many businesses and civil society groups are advocating for varying degrees of regulation. For example, Microsoft has proposed a comprehensive approach in its, “Governing AI: A Blueprint for the Future”. It would create a new government AI agency, a new AI-legal framework, require safety brakes for AI systems that control critical infrastructure, and would license AI datacenters that run critical AI.  

AI rules create winners and losers, as some are constrained, and others have more freedom and resources. Governments—leery of being criticized for heavy handed regulation—are quick to speak of innovation but are also responding to public concerns about AI.
