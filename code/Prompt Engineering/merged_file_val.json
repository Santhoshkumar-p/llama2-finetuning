In contrast, the U.S. approach relies on sectorally specific regulations and non-binding guidance, with regulatory plans developed slowly across federal agencies. Enforcement in the EU is backed by investigatory powers and significant fines for non-compliance, whereas U.S. agencies may need to pursue novel litigation without explicit legal authority to regulate algorithms. Despite some overlap in principles, the U.S. and EU approaches exhibit significant differences in regulatory scope, transparency, and enforcement mechanisms."
