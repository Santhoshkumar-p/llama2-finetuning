List the most pressing topics regarding regulation of AI.
The most pressing topics regarding regulation of AI are:
1. Privacy and data protection: AI systems can collect and process vast amounts of personal data, which raises concerns about privacy and data protection.
2. Bias and discrimination: AI systems can perpetuate existing biases and discrimination, which can have a disproportionate impact on certain groups of people.
3. Accountability and transparency: AI systems can

Who owns material generated by a company’s large language model?
The question of who owns the intellectual property generated by a company’s large language model (LLM) is a complex one.
The answer depends on the specifics of the contract between the company and the LLM developer.
In general, the company that owns the LLM will own the intellectual property generated by the LLM.
However, there are some exceptions to this rule.
For example, if the LLM is developed by a third-party company, the
