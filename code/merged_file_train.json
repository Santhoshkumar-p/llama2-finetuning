In response, the Defense Department, Defense Intelligence Unit, and AI company Quantifind launched the Countering Malign Influence project. The project uses open-source data to identify, track, and counter transnational criminal groups attempting to mask their identities and activities. The speed and volume of data collected would be too large for human analysts alone to process.\nHealth: Data collection for health research typically lacks participants with diverse backgrounds. NIH\u0092s Bridge2AI program builds participant diversity into the design of all funded projects. For example, Bridge2AI recently funded a University of Washington-led coalition to create a flagship, ethically sourced data set to uncover how human health is restored after disease. The effort, which is using Type 2 diabetes as a case study, will recruit an equal number of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, and white participants while engaging with tribal communities to address barriers to participation.\nEarth Science: Rip currents cause hundreds of drownings and require tens of thousands of rescues annually.

        "output": "CRISPR is a controversial gene modification technique that can be used to alter the presentation of genes in living organisms, for example for the purpose of curing or preventing genetic diseases. It is closely related to AI, as Machine Learning techniques can be used to identify which gene or genes need to be altered with the CRISPR method. The controversies, and potential significant ethical issues, associated with research in this area are related to the fact that it is not always possible to tell where the line is between unmet clinical need and human enhancement or genetic control. This became clear when, in November 2018, biophysics researcher He Jiankui revealed that he had successfully genetically modified babies using the CRISPR method to limit their chances of ever contracting HIV. The announcement was met with international outcry and He\u0092s experiment was condemned by the Chinese government at the time. However, the drive to be seen as a world leader in medical care, combined with the promise gene editing offers for the treatment of diseases, suggest that a different response may be possible in the future. Such a change in government policy is especially likely as global competition in this field heats up. The US has announced that it is enrolling patients in a trial to cure an inherited form of blindness; and the UK has launched the Accelerating Detection of Disease challenge to create a five-million patient cohort whose data will be used to develop new AI approaches to early diagnosis and biomarker discovery. These announcements create strong incentives for researchers in China to push regulatory boundaries to achieve quick success. China has filed the largest number of patents for gene-editing on animals in the world"

        "input": " The important issues in the field of global data access, sharing, and governance include which global topics?",
        "output": " Access to and sharing of data are critical to enable AI\u2019s benefits across sectors. Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, cooperation, and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximize its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include: First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared, and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its reuse. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying, and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and reuse for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges."

        "output": " First, It includes using Machine learning models and techniques to learn in an automated manner through patterns and inferences rather than explicit instructions from a human. Second, Connectivity allows the transfer of large volumes of data in real or quasi-real time, while computing infrastructure (hardware and software) executes the mathematical operations needed to calibrate or train an AI system and infer its results. The combination of high-quality connectivity, data, computing infrastructure, and AI technologies continues to enable innovative and disruptive new services."

How can we ensure that algorithms do not infringe fundamental human rights\u2014from privacy and data confidentiality to freedom of choice and freedom of conscience? Can freedom of action be guaranteed when our desires are anticipated and guided? How can we ensure that social and cultural stereotypes are not replicated in AI programming, notably when it comes to gender discrimination? Can these circuits be duplicated? Can values be programmed, and by whom? How can we ensure accountability when decisions and actions are fully automated? How do we make sure that no one\u2014wherever they are in the world\u2014is deprived of the benefits of these technologies? How do we ensure that AI is developed in a transparent way, so that global citizens, whose lives it affects, have a say in its development?"

        "output": " First, UNESCO will be a full and active participant in this global conversation. The organization has many years of experience in the ethics of science and technology. Its advisory bodies have already produced numerous reports and declarations, including on robotics, such as the Report of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology on Robotics Ethics in 2017. The advisory bodies also have experience in developing normative instruments, including the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights in 2005. Second, UNESCO ensures that Africa fully participates in transformations related to AI, not only as a beneficiary but also upstream, contributing directly to its development. In terms of gender equality, UNESCO fights against the biases in the societies to guarantee that they are not reproduced in AI applications. Finally, UNESCO empowers young people by providing them with the skills they need for life in the twenty-first century for integration in a changing labor market. Third, UNESCO also has a key role to play in bridging existing divides, which AI is likely to deepen. Eliminating fragmentation between countries and genders, but also in terms of resources and knowledge, could enable more people to contribute to the digital transformation underway. What's more, UNESCO, with its humanist mission and international dimension, involving researchers, philosophers, programmers, policymakers, and private sector and civil society representatives, is the natural home for debate on such ethical issues. Last but not least, UNESCO is performing its role to the fullest, informing the global debate on the major transformations of its time while establishing principles to ensure that technological advances are used to serve the common good. The promise of AI and its underlying ethical issues are fascinating, and UNESCO's responses to these challenges will transform the world as UNESCO knows it."
