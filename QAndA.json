      "output": "Defense: The Biden administration called the transnational organized crime a billion-dollar problem affecting millions of lives through drug overdose, violence, firearm deaths, and human trafficking. In response, the Defense Department, Defense Intelligence Unit, and AI company Quantifind launched the Countering Malign Influence project. The project uses open-source data to identify, track, and counter transnational criminal groups attempting to mask their identities and activities. The speed and volume of data collected would be too large for human analysts alone to process.\nHealth: Data collection for health research typically lacks participants with diverse backgrounds. NIHs Bridge2AI program builds participant diversity into the design of all funded projects. For example, Bridge2AI recently funded a University of Washington-led coalition to create a flagship, ethically sourced data set to uncover how human health is restored after disease. The effort, which is using Type 2 diabetes as a case study, will recruit an equal number of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, and white participants while engaging with tribal communities to address barriers to participation.\nEarth Science: Rip currents cause hundreds of drownings and require tens of thousands of rescues annually. In response, NOAA launched the first national rip current forecast model to inform coastal communities and visitors about the risk of rip currents. The model uses AI to generate the probability of a rip current based on NOAA Coastal Observation Networks."

      "input": "What are the possible biases that have been detected in healthcare ML produced by ML interactions with patients?",
      "output": "In the ML-patient interaction case, it is possible to detect biases including: \nPrivilege bias, i.e. some models may be unavailable in settings where protected groups receive care or require technology/sensors disproportionately available to the nonprotected class, and this also exacerbates existing inequalities between the haves and the have-nots in terms of access to the digital healthcare ecosystem; in other words, those that generate enough data on themselves to ensure accurately trained algorithms and those that do not.\nInformed mistrust bias that is given by the patients diffidence based on historical exploitation and unethical practices; protected groups may believe that a model is biased against them, and these patients may avoid seeking care from clinicians or systems that use the model or deliberately omit information, while the protected group may be harmed by this, as it results in them not receiving appropriate care and not interacting with the model, as it enhances the issue of lack of data representativeness and accuracy of that group.\nAgency bias (deeply connected to privilege bias): protected groups may not have input into the development, use and evaluation of models. Thus, they may not have the resources, education or political influence to detect biases, protest and force correction concerning the consideration or treatment of patients, especially those belonging to protected groups."

      "input": "Tell me about CRISPR and AI and Chinas stance on this being an ethical risk.",
      "output": "CRISPR is a controversial gene modification technique that can be used to alter the presentation of genes in living organisms, for example for the purpose of curing or preventing genetic diseases. It is closely related to AI, as Machine Learning techniques can be used to identify which gene or genes need to be altered with the CRISPR method. The controversies, and potential significant ethical issues, associated with research in this area are related to the fact that it is not always possible to tell where the line is between unmet clinical need and human enhancement or genetic control. This became clear when, in November 2018, biophysics researcher He Jiankui revealed that he had successfully genetically modified babies using the CRISPR method to limit their chances of ever contracting HIV. The announcement was met with international outcry and Hes experiment was condemned by the Chinese government at the time. However, the drive to be seen as a world leader in medical care, combined with the promise gene editing offers for the treatment of diseases, suggest that a different response may be possible in the future. Such a change in government policy is especially likely as global competition in this field heats up. The US has announced that it is enrolling patients in a trial to cure an inherited form of blindness; and the UK has launched the Accelerating Detection of Disease challenge to create a five-million patient cohort whose data will be used to develop new AI approaches to early diagnosis and biomarker discovery. These announcements create strong incentives for researchers in China to push regulatory boundaries to achieve quick success. China has filed the largest number of patents for gene-editing on animals in the world"
